- Team Fight Participations
- CS Efficiency => lhten / 80, check per minute

  Starting Gold = 600g
  Total passive gold @ 10mns = 1030g
  Range Creep = avg 47,5 = 950g
  Melee Creep = avg 36,5 * 60 = 2190g
  Total Gold from creeps = 3140g @ 80creeps || 39,25g/creep
  Total Gold = 4770g @ 10 minutes
  Lane efficiency => Gold @ 10minutes Divided by 4770g
  e.g. Winter Wyvern in game 6227492909, kill 13 creeps => 510,25g + 600g + 1030g = 
  Lane Efficiency = 1904,75/4770 = 44,87% from 100%
